##Forever Chat iMessage Export

##What

This module reads from the iMessage chat.db database and provides you with an output in the [forever chat format](http://github.com/jkeen/forever-chat-format)

##Todo

It would be great to get a sample chat.db database for testing. I'm using my own for local testing, but I'm not sharing years of text messages to the internet, thankyouverymuch. If somebody comes across this and is willing to donate their own, create one, or has access to one of the Apple store demo images and can snag that staged oneâ€”I would be very appreciative.

- Send errors
- Fix some attachment paths that are buried inside iOS databases
